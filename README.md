#2048

Just an ugly clone by Todd Beckman.

There's a story to this one. The internet at my house died and I was bored. 2048 seemed like a good way to fix the boredom. Naturally I didn't have internet to open it so I had to make my own. I also didn't remember the exact function names for key listeners so it works with button clicks instead of the nice arrow presses.

Scratch that. I got internet so I added key listeners. Arrows work just fine.


## Usage
There are no dependencies. Just download the zip or clone this repository and open index.html in your favorite browser.

## Known issues
Tiles with values bearing more than 2 digits are too big. May fix if the internet goes out again.
